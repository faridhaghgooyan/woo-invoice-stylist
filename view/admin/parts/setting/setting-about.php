        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Woo Invoice Stylist - the perfect plugin for anyone who wants to give their invoices a modern and professional appearance. I created this plugin to give business owners the ability to customize their invoices and make them stand out.

            But I didn't stop there - I have big plans for Woo Invoice Stylist! In the future, I plan to add features such as
            <b>invoice download statistics</b>
            and the ability to
            <b>share invoices with friends</b>
            . I will also continue to add
            <b>new templates</b>
            to keep up with the latest design trends and provide even more options for customization.

            I hope you enjoy using Invoice Styler as much as I do, and I look forward to continuing to improve the plugin and add new features
            <b>based on your feedback</b>.
        </p>
