## :dart: Description ##

This plugin allows WordPress site administrators to customize their user order invoices by modifying the data displayed and choosing from multiple templates. I am already working on these features:
- Sharing on Social networks
- Download and print statics
- Modern invoice templates

## :notebook: Installation ##

- Download the plugin ZIP file.
- Upload the plugin to your WordPress site.
- Activate the plugin through the WordPress plugins page.



## :keyboard: Usage ##

- Navigate to the Invoice Stylist settings page in the WordPress admin panel.
- Choose the template you want to use for your user order invoices.
- Customize the data displayed on the invoices by selecting the fields you want to include.
- Save your changes and your user order invoices will now use the selected template and display the customized data.
